# Assignment 6.3
## Problem 6.3 Sort array of 0's,1's and 2's
Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascendingorder. Example 1:Input:N = 5arr[]= {0 2 1 2 0}Output:0 0 1 2 2Explanation: 0's 1's and 2's are segregated into ascending order.Example 2:Input:N = 3arr[] = {0 1 0}Output:0 0 1Explanation: 0s 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order. Time Complexity: O(N)Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)Constraints: 1 <= N <= 10^6 0 <= A[i] <= 2
